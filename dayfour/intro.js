/**
What is DOM?
“The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that 
allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, 
and style of a document.”

The DOM is an abstraction of a page’s HTML structure. It takes HTML elements and wraps 
them in an object with a tree-structure — maintaining the parent/child relationships of 
those nested HTML elements. This provides an API that allows us to traverse nodes 
(HTML elements) and manipulate them in a number of ways — such as adding nodes, 
removing nodes, editing a node’s content, etc.
